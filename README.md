WP Plugin to create custom gutenberg block

What is gutenberg?
“Gutenberg” is the codename for the new WordPress editor focus. The goal of this focus is to create a new post and page editing experience that makes it easy for anyone to create rich post layouts.

In coming days wordpress will incorporate the gutenberg editor into its core and now, all the designers and developer needs to start getting used to this editor.

At the core of Gutenberg lies the concept of the block. A post in Gutenberg is then a collection of blocks.
